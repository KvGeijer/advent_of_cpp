# Advent of C++
The goal is to learn some basics in the language, and hopefully pick up some tricks. The main reason for wanting to learn C++ is that it is commonly used for implementing data structures from research papers. I know C which is also common, but C++ feels like it has some nice tools which can be helpful for structuring code.
